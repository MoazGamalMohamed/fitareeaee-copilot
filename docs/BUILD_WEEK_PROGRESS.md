# Fitareeaee Build Week Progress Log

This is an append-only continuity log. Add a dated checkpoint after every implementation stage. Do not rewrite older results; correct mistakes in a new entry.

## 2026-07-17 — Rules review and technical baseline

### Contest findings

- Official submission deadline: July 21, 2026 at 5:00 PM Pacific / 7:00 PM Central.
- Chosen track: Apps for Your Life.
- Because the project predates July 13, only meaningful Build Week extensions are judged. New work needs dated Codex/GPT-5.6 evidence.
- Required artifacts include an English description, public YouTube demo under three minutes with audio, repository/testing access, README describing Codex/GPT-5.6 collaboration, and the main `/feedback` Codex Session ID.
- Recommended new extension: Fitareeaee Copilot, a GPT-5.6 natural-language trip planner plus deterministic transparent matching.

### Repository baseline

- Branch: `master`
- HEAD: `93780b7` (`Feature: Exclude user's own trips from Available trips section`)
- No commits exist after the Build Week submission window opened.
- The working tree already contains extensive uncommitted pre-existing work. It must be checkpointed as pre-existing baseline and must not be represented as new Build Week work.
- No Git remote is configured.
- GitHub CLI is not installed; the installed GitHub connector/skill or a configured remote will be needed for publication.
- A tracked `.env` exists in Git history. Credentials must be rotated and the submission repository sanitized before it becomes public.

### Verification results

- `flutter doctor -v`: PASS. Flutter 3.38.3, Dart 3.10.1, Android SDK 36.1.0, JDK 21, all Android licenses accepted, no doctor issues.
- `flutter analyze`: completed with no compile errors and 75 findings (mostly production logging/style, with three warnings).
- `flutter test`: PASS, 6/6 tests.
- `functions/npm run build`: PASS.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: PASS.
- APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
- APK size: 149.15 MB.
- APK SHA-256: `2E481974E61F47E5BC40DA0419D449DF687BAF5D4A0C74435B43A2038D483F85`
- Connected Android phone: none at baseline. Windows, Chrome, and Edge were detected.

### Important limitation

The baseline APK compiles but is not judge-ready: current Firebase initialization contains placeholder options, and several routes/backend schemas/security rules remain inconsistent.

### Tooling continuity

- The official `openaiDeveloperDocs` MCP server was installed globally for authoritative OpenAI API documentation. Restart Codex before the implementation session so the connector is available.
- Approved command families obtained during planning include Flutter tests, Flutter doctor, Android APK builds, and OpenAI docs MCP installation. Product/security/network actions may still require scoped approval.

### Next action

Start Stage 0 in `BUILD_WEEK_MASTER_PLAN.md`: create the explicit pre-existing baseline checkpoint, configure the GitHub destination, sanitize secrets, restore Firebase startup, and rerun the baseline gate.

## 2026-07-17 21:10 CDT / 19:10 PDT — Pre-existing baseline checkpoint

### Objective

Preserve the complete dirty project without claiming it as contest work, create the Build Week boundary, and prevent the tracked local environment file from entering new commits.

### Work completed

- Created `build-week/final` from `master` without resetting or discarding any file.
- Added `docs/PRE_BUILD_WEEK_BASELINE.md` with the old HEAD, pre-existing capabilities, dirty-tree inventory, validation results, configuration risks, and the exact Build Week boundary.
- Removed `.env` from Git tracking while preserving the ignored local file.
- Scanned the working tree by sensitive filename and key signature. No private key, service account, keystore, OpenAI key, or non-placeholder Stripe secret was found outside the ignored `.env`.
- Committed the entire confirmed pre-existing working tree as baseline and added an annotated baseline tag.
- Re-checked the live Devpost overview, FAQ, resources, updates, and indexed Official Rules. Requirements remain unchanged: meaningful dated extension, working test build, English materials, public YouTube demo at most three minutes with audio, repository/testing access, README evidence, and primary `/feedback` Session ID.

### Files changed

- `docs/PRE_BUILD_WEEK_BASELINE.md`
- `.env` Git index state only; the local ignored file remains present
- all previously dirty tracked/untracked files were captured in the baseline commit

### Commands and results

- `git switch -c build-week/final`: PASS
- `git rm --cached -- .env`: PASS; local file verified present and ignored
- sensitive filename/key-pattern scan: PASS; no publish-blocking secret file detected outside `.env`
- `git commit -m "chore(build-week): snapshot pre-existing baseline (not submission work)"`: PASS
- `git tag -a build-week-preexisting-baseline ...`: PASS
- Full Flutter/Functions/APK gate: not rerun in this checkpoint; the previous baseline results remain recorded above. Stage 0 is not complete until the gate is rerun after Firebase stabilization.

### Source and artifact record

- Baseline commit: `69f9a704c9612d0524a2027275ab0d259508bd49`
- Tag: `build-week-preexisting-baseline`
- Branch: `build-week/final`
- Push/PR: BLOCKED; no remote is configured and GitHub CLI required by `github:yeet` is not installed
- APK: unchanged baseline debug APK, `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
- APK SHA-256: `2E481974E61F47E5BC40DA0419D449DF687BAF5D4A0C74435B43A2038D483F85`
- Tested device: no Android phone connected; install result not claimed

### Known issues and rollback point

- Old local history still contains `.env`; it must not be published as the public submission history. Use a clean sanitized public repository/history.
- Firebase startup still uses placeholder options.
- Release Android networking, rules, authorization, schema, and judge-path work remains.
- Rollback/reference point: annotated tag `build-week-preexisting-baseline` at `69f9a704c9612d0524a2027275ab0d259508bd49`.

### Next action

Stabilize Firebase Android configuration and the secure judge path, then run and record the complete Stage 0 gate. Continue local implementation while GitHub CLI/remote and the Codex restart remain external publication/tooling actions.

## 2026-07-17 21:32 CDT / 19:32 PDT — Stage 0 Android/Firebase checkpoint

### Objective

Make the authoritative root Android app start against the intended Firebase project, remove immediate release/configuration blockers, and produce an installed baseline for Build Week implementation.

### Work completed

- Verified through the authenticated Firebase CLI that project `fitareeaee` is active and its registered Android package is `com.fitareeaee.app`.
- Aligned Android `applicationId`, namespace, and `MainActivity` package to `com.fitareeaee.app`.
- Added the Google Services Gradle plugin and restored `android/app/google-services.json` only as an ignored local build file. No Firebase client configuration was recommitted.
- Switched native Firebase startup from literal `YOUR_*` options to the Android platform configuration and added an exact project-ID guard.
- Added guarded Firebase bootstrap loading, retry, and human-readable failure UI instead of trapping the app on the native splash screen.
- Added release `INTERNET` permission, updated the Android label, and removed background-location and legacy broad-storage permissions from the submitted application manifest.
- Added `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json` pinned to the confirmed `fitareeaee` project with Functions/Firestore/Storage/emulator configuration. No deployment was performed.
- Removed client-side Stripe and OpenRouter key constants from `Environment`; OpenAI will be server-only.
- Expanded secret/config ignores and `.env.example` guidance.
- Applied Dart formatting to the existing source tree as an isolated mechanical commit so the mandatory format gate is reproducible.
- Installed the APK on the local Android API 36.1 emulator and confirmed the resumed `com.fitareeaee.app/.MainActivity` renders the Login screen. Captured logs contained no fatal or Firebase startup error.

### Files changed

- `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.firebaserc`, `firebase.json`, `analysis_options.yaml`
- `android/settings.gradle.kts`, `android/app/build.gradle.kts`, `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/fitareeaee/app/MainActivity.kt`
- `lib/core/config/environment.dart`, `lib/core/config/firebase_config.dart`, `lib/main.dart`
- Dart formatter normalization across `lib/` and `test/`

### Commands and exact results

- `firebase projects:list --json`: PASS; authenticated account includes active `fitareeaee`
- `firebase apps:list ANDROID --project fitareeaee --json`: PASS; package `com.fitareeaee.app`
- `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test`: PASS; 141 files, 0 changes after normalization
- `flutter analyze`: PASS; `No issues found!`
- `flutter test`: PASS; 6/6 tests
- Focused new tests: none in Stage 0; Firebase bootstrap was verified through Android smoke testing
- `npm run build` in `functions/`: PASS; TypeScript compiler exit 0
- `flutter build apk --debug`: PASS in 176.1 seconds
- `adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`: PASS; `Success`
- Android startup smoke: PASS on emulator; Login semantics (`Welcome Back`, email/password, `Sign In`) present and app process/activity alive

### APK record

- Build type: debug, universal
- Path: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
- Size: 156,206,854 bytes / 148.97 MiB
- SHA-256: `915569E41C62E47828E8D49BA795B671711B1469F759BADA35C7695BD31D11AD`
- Build timestamp: 2026-07-17 21:27:02 CDT
- Source commit: `bd63baa4b156f3ff9d2b9d4068e0ecf8d86fa7cb`
- Formatter checkpoint: `a45ccb6`
- Tested device: Android emulator `sdk_gphone64_x86_64`, API 36.1, `emulator-5554`
- Installation result: PASS
- Smoke result: PASS to unauthenticated Login screen; credentialed sign-in was not attempted because no test credential was supplied

### Git and publication

- Functional commit: `bd63baa4b156f3ff9d2b9d4068e0ecf8d86fa7cb` (`fix(core): stabilize Android Firebase judge path`)
- Mechanical formatting commit: `a45ccb6` (`style: normalize Dart formatting for Build Week gates`)
- Branch: `build-week/final`
- Tag: baseline tag unchanged; Stage 0 tag deferred until the progress record is committed
- Push/PR: still blocked by missing GitHub CLI and remote; no unsafe publication attempted

### Known issues and rollback point

- Physical phone test and credentialed login remain manual/user-dependent; emulator startup passed.
- Firestore/Storage rules, transactional booking, verification authorization, unsafe payment callables, and chat query security are Stage 1 work and are not deployed.
- The Android Maps key remains a placeholder; maps are outside the core judge path unless stabilized.
- Public publication still requires sanitized new history because old local ancestry contains tracked `.env`.
- Rollback point: `bd63baa4b156f3ff9d2b9d4068e0ecf8d86fa7cb`; pre-existing rollback/reference remains `build-week-preexisting-baseline`.

### Next action

Implement Stage 1 server-authoritative booking, default-deny matching Firestore/Storage rules, verification/payment lockdown, secure chat access, and judge-route cleanup with focused negative tests.
